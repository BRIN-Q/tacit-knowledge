In many optical experiments, the laser beam does not strike the target directly. Instead, it is steered and reflected by a series of mirrors mounted on kinematic mounts, allowing precise adjustment of the beam’s direction and alignment along the optical path.

Here you will learn how to align the laser using two mirrors. The goal is to make the laser beam pass cleanly through the centers of Iris 1 (I1) and Iris2 (I2) using two mirrors (M1, M2) on kinematic mounts, as displayed in Figure 1.

Step 1: Rough alignment with M1
- Turn on the laser at low power.
- Adjust M1’s yaw and pitch screws so the reflected beam reaches M2.
- Use a white card near M2 to locate the spot.
The goal: beam hits approximately the center of M2’s mirror.

Step 2: Establish the output direction using M2
- Now use M2’s kinematic screws (pitch/yaw) to steer the reflected beam.
- Adjust M2 until the beam passes through the center of both irises (I1 & I2).
- Watch both irises: when both centers are illuminated simultaneously, your beam is straight.
Don’t worry yet if the beam hits M2 slightly off-center — that will be fixed next.

Step 3: Refine M1 to center the beam on M2
- Place a white card just in front of M2 and mark its center.
- Adjust M1’s pitch/yaw so the beam spot hits the center of M2 without moving the beam through I1/I2 too much.
- After each M1 tweak, recheck I1/I2 — small corrections on M2 may be needed.
M1 controls beam position on M2,
M2 controls beam direction through I1/I2.

Step 4: Iterate
Alternate between:
M1: moves beam position on M2,
M2: directs beam through both irises.

After a few small adjustments, you should have:
✅ Beam centered on M2,
✅ Beam passing through centers of I1 and I2.

Step 5: Fine-tune
- Gradually close the irises further.
- If the beam still passes cleanly through both, your alignment is excellent.
- Lock the mirror mounts (if they have lock nuts) and recheck.

You can confirm collinearity by sliding I2 farther downstream — the beam should still go through both centers.
