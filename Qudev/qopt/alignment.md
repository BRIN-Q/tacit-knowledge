In many optical experiments, the laser beam does not strike the target directly. Instead, it is steered and reflected by a series of mirrors mounted on kinematic mounts, allowing precise adjustment of the beam’s direction and alignment along the optical path.

Alignment procedure (step-by-step)
1 — Rough aim & check reach

• Turn the laser on at low power. If the beam currently does not hit M1 or M2 at all, rotate M1 coarse so the beam intercepts M1, then rotate M1 so the reflected beam reaches M2. Use a piece of card to see the spot locations.
(Goal: ensure beam actually reaches M2 and then travels down toward the irises.)

2 — Align the output axis with the irises using M2

• With the beam hitting M2, use M2’s tip/tilt to steer the reflected beam so it goes through the center of I1 and I2 simultaneously.
• Because I1 and I2 are collinear, steering M2 so the beam passes through both centers sets the final output direction.
(Important: make only small adjustments and watch both irises — you want the same centering on both.)

3 — Make the beam hit the center of M2 using M1

• Now adjust M1 so the beam strikes the center of M2 while still going through I1 and I2.
• Small adjustments on M1 move the spot on M2; small adjustments on M2 change the downstream pointing. So:

Turn M1 slightly to place the spot at M2’s center.

If that move knocked the irises off center, re-tweak M2 to recenter through I1/I2.
• Repeat: alternate small tweaks on M1 (to position on M2) and M2 (to correct pointing through I1/I2) until both conditions are satisfied: beam centered on M2 and beam passes through both irises.

4 — Fine tuning

• Close the irises a little more and re-center. The beam should pass cleanly through both small apertures.
• Walk the beam: if you move I2 further away and the beam remains centered in both, the beam is well collimated along that axis.
• When satisfied, gently tighten the mirror mounts’ locks (first coarse tighten M2, then M1) and re-check — locking can nudge the alignment, so re-center if needed.
